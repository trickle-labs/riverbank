## 1. The idea in one paragraph

Andrej Karpathy proposed treating knowledge preparation as compilation. You do
not run source code directly; you compile it into a form the machine can execute
quickly and reliably. The same pattern applies to knowledge: take messy human
documents, compile them into structured facts, summaries, relationships, and
questions, then query the compiled result at runtime rather than re-reading raw
text every time.

pg_ripple and pg_trickle make this idea significantly stronger than the original
description, because they turn a compiled knowledge base into a **living one**:
one that updates incrementally as sources change, validates its own quality,
ranks its own entries by importance and freshness, and publishes semantic change
events to downstream consumers.

The product this enables is not simply "RAG with RDF". It is a
**knowledge build system inside PostgreSQL**: sources in, structured governed
knowledge out, incremental updates, and a full audit trail.

---

## 2. The compiler analogy

The core insight is that raw documents are a bad runtime format for AI systems.
They repeat themselves, bury assumptions, rely on context that lives elsewhere,
and require the LLM to reinterpret prose from scratch on every query.

The standard fix is RAG: split documents into chunks, embed them, retrieve
similar chunks at query time. That helps, but it has well-known limits. A chunk
can lose the context that gave it meaning. Similarity is not the same as
correctness. Multi-document reasoning is fragile. Answers vary with chunking
and retrieval settings.

Compilation does more work before query time:

| Software compiler | LLM knowledge compiler |
|---|---|
| Source code | Raw documents, PDFs, tickets, transcripts, events |
| Compiler | LLM workflow that extracts and structures meaning |
| Compiled binary | Governed knowledge graph |
| Runtime | Querying compiled facts, summaries, and relationships |
| Compiler errors | Low-confidence extractions, contradictions, missing evidence |
| Incremental build | Reprocess only changed fragments and their dependants |

The hardest part of this design is **incremental compilation**: when one
document changes, only the knowledge that depends on that document should
rebuild. That is exactly what pg_ripple and pg_trickle solve together.

---

## 2.1 Karpathy's three-layer structure

Karpathy's LLM Wiki document names three layers precisely. Understanding them
clarifies where riverbank sits and where it goes further.

**Raw sources** are immutable. The LLM reads them and never modifies them. They
are the source of truth — a quarantine boundary that prevents the compiled layer
from silently corrupting its own inputs.

**The wiki** (in our terms, the compiled graph) is entirely LLM-owned. It is
created, updated, and maintained by the compiler. Humans read it; the LLM writes
it. This division is important: humans should not need to hand-edit compiled
artifacts any more than they hand-edit a compiled binary.

**The schema** is a configuration document — CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or in our
design, the compiler profile (§7.3). It tells the LLM how the compiled layer is
structured, what conventions apply, and what workflows to follow when ingesting,
querying, or linting. Karpathy's key insight is that the schema is
**co-evolved** with the LLM over time as you discover what works for your domain.
Our compiler profiles extend this: they are versioned, diffable, and
audit-trailed — the schema cannot drift silently.

Karpathy names three operations that map directly to riverbank
primitives:

| Operation | Description | riverbank equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| **Ingest** | Read a source, discuss key takeaways, write pages, update index and log | Source hash check → fragment extraction → LLM compile → ingest gate → SHACL gate → graph write → outbox event |
| **Query** | Ask against the compiled wiki; file good answers back as pages | SPARQL + `rag_context()` → synthesis artifact filed as `pgc:Synthesis` node (§9.5) |
| **Lint** | Health-check: contradictions, stale claims, orphan pages, missing cross-references, data gaps | Scheduled lint pass → `pgc:LintFinding` graph → watchpoint triggers (§10.21) |

The lint operation in particular is underweighted in most RAG and compiled-wiki
implementations. It is not a background diagnostic — it is a first-class
operation that domain experts should be able to initiate, review, and act on.

## 3. What pg_ripple already provides

pg_ripple already covers most of what a compiled knowledge base needs.

| Need | pg_ripple capability |
|---|---|
| Store structured facts | RDF triples in PostgreSQL VP storage |
| Query relationships | SPARQL 1.1 with full property paths and aggregates |
| Natural-language queries | `sparql_from_nl()` — English to SPARQL |
| LLM-ready context | `rag_context()` — graph facts formatted for a prompt; `rag_retrieve()` — end-to-end RAG pipeline |
| Source attribution | Named graphs and PROV-O provenance |
| Facts about facts | RDF-star annotations for confidence, evidence, timestamps |
| Assign extraction confidence | `load_triples_with_confidence()`, `pg:confidence()` (v0.87) |
| Propagate source trust | `pg:sourceTrust` predicate, automatic PROV-O Datalog rules (v0.87) |
| Probabilistic inference | Datalog rules with `@weight` and noisy-OR combination (v0.87) |
| Fuzzy entity matching | `pg:fuzzy_match()`, `pg:token_set_ratio()`, GIN trigram index (v0.87) — in-database fuzzy matching without external Python libraries |
| Numeric data quality scores | `shacl_score()`, `sh:severityWeight`, `shacl_report_scored()` (v0.87) |
| Validate knowledge quality | SHACL shapes as data quality contracts |
| Infer new knowledge | Datalog and RDFS/OWL 2 RL rules |
| Auto-derive on data change | CONSTRUCT writeback rules — auto-fire when source triples change (v0.63–v0.65); no external scheduler needed for derived facts |
| Resolve duplicate entities | `owl:sameAs` canonicalization; `suggest_sameas()` vector-based candidates (v0.49); `find_alignments()` KGE-based cross-graph matching (v0.57); `pagerank_find_duplicates()` centrality-guided entity dedup (v0.88) |
| Rank entities by importance | PageRank, topic-sensitive scoring, temporal decay (v0.88) |
| Detect bridge concepts | Betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality (v0.88) |
| Find recent authorities | Katz centrality with time-aware edge weights (v0.88) |
| Explain importance scores | `explain_pagerank()` score-explanation tree with depth/contributor/contribution/path (v0.88) |
| Incremental importance updates | pg-trickle K-hop rank propagation in milliseconds (v0.88) |
| Hybrid graph + vector retrieval | pgvector integration and graph-contextualized embeddings |
| GraphRAG export | GraphRAG Parquet export and community detection |
| Export compiled knowledge | `export_pagerank()` in CSV, Turtle, N-Triples, JSON-LD (v0.88); `export_turtle_with_confidence()` with RDF-star annotations (v0.87) |
| JSON↔RDF mapping | `register_json_mapping()` bidirectional JSON↔RDF mapping registry (v0.73) — maps structured LLM output directly to RDF without custom conversion code |
| Bi-temporal fact management | Named-graph time-travel + RDF-star valid/transaction time |
| Bidirectional integration | Conflict policies (`source_priority`, `latest_wins`, `reject_on_conflict`, `union`), outbox/inbox wiring, dead-letter queue, reconciliation toolkit (v0.77–v0.78) — enables the human correction loop to flow back into the graph with conflict resolution |
| Live subscriptions | SPARQL live subscriptions via SSE for real-time downstream notification (v0.73) |
| Prioritize human review | Centrality × confidence review queue — maximum leverage per review hour |
| Stream knowledge changes | CDC subscriptions and JSON-LD event output; CDC bridge triggers for pg-tide integration (v0.52) |
| Vocabulary alignment | Built-in Datalog rule templates for cross-domain ontology mapping: Schema.org↔SAREF, Schema.org↔FHIR, Schema.org↔PROV-O, generic-JSON↔Schema.org (v0.52) |
| Multi-tenant isolation | Per-tenant named graphs with RLS, quota enforcement, tenant lifecycle API (v0.57) |
| Privacy and compliance | `erase_subject()` GDPR right-to-erasure across all tables (v0.61); per-graph access control and RLS policies |
| JSONB PageRank explanation | `explain_pagerank_json(node_iri, top_k)` — machine-readable JSONB explanation tree; complements `explain_pagerank()` for programmatic consumption and API integration (v0.91) |
| SHACL score history management | `vacuum_shacl_score_log()` removes entries older than `pg_ripple.shacl_score_log_retention_days` (default 30 days); keeps quality-trend history bounded in long-running deployments (v0.91) |
| Implicit SPARQL `pg:` prefix | `pg:` prefix auto-declared in `sparql()` and `sparql_ask()` when used without an explicit `PREFIX` declaration — no boilerplate needed in riverbank SPARQL queries (v0.91) |
| Concurrent PageRank safety | Per-topic advisory lock on `pagerank_run()`; `pagerank_partition` defaults to `true`, auto-tuning across CPUs and named-graph count — safe for parallel compilation workers without external coordination (v0.90–v0.92) |
| Parallel-safe fuzzy matching | `pg:fuzzy_match()` and `pg:token_set_ratio()` reclassified `STABLE parallel_safe` — usable in parallel query plans and views without function-volatility barriers (v0.92) |
| Detect pg_tide availability | `pg_ripple.pg_tide_available()` runtime detection; relay API calls emit a `PGTIDE_HINT` diagnostic when pg_tide is not installed — supports `riverbank health` integration check (v0.93) |

The missing product layer is the step that takes raw human-readable sources and
reliably turns them into that compiled artifact. That is `riverbank`.

## 4. What pg_trickle adds

The article treats incremental compilation as a hard problem. pg_trickle gives
us a practical solution.

**Architecture note (v0.46.0).** pg_trickle is now IVM-only. The full
transactional outbox, inbox, and relay subsystem was extracted to the standalone
`pg_tide` extension. The only remaining integration point is
`pgtrickle.attach_outbox(stream_table)`, which registers a pg_tide outbox for
a stream table so that every non-empty IVM refresh delivers a delta-summary
event inside the same transaction — preserving the ADR-001/ADR-002
single-transaction atomicity guarantee.

**New capabilities since the plans were last updated:**

- **pgVector incremental aggregates (v0.37).** Stream tables can maintain
  `avg(embedding)::vector` and `sum(embedding)` over `vector`, `halfvec`, and
  `sparsevec` columns incrementally, with no full scan on INSERT. riverbank can
  maintain live per-entity-cluster centroid views that update in milliseconds
  when a new compiled fact arrives — used by `rag_retrieve()` to find the most
  relevant entity cluster before fetching individual facts.
- **W3C Trace Context propagation (v0.37).** Set `pg_trickle.trace_id` to a W3C
  `traceparent` string before a DML operation and pg_trickle captures it in the
  change buffer, then emits an OTLP span covering the full CDC→DVM→merge cycle.
  This links every compilation refresh to its originating LLM call in Langfuse,
  enabling precise end-to-end latency and cost attribution per source fragment.
- **`preflight()` health check (v0.45).** `pgtrickle.preflight()` returns a JSON
  report with 7 system checks (shared_preload_libraries, scheduler running,
  worker budget, WAL level, replication slots). Called by `riverbank health` to
  catch misconfigured deployments before the first ingest.
- **Lag-aware scheduling (v0.45).** `pg_trickle.lag_aware_scheduling = on`
  boosts the per-database refresh quota proportionally to refresh lag (up to 2×),
  accelerating catch-up during large initial ingests without starving other
  databases.
- **`repair_stream_table()` (v0.42).** Rebuilds missing CDC triggers, recreates
  change buffer tables, and resets error-fuse state after a PITR restore or
  partial failure — part of the production disaster-recovery runbook.
- **`wal_source_status()` (v0.43).** Per-source WAL diagnostic view showing CDC
  mode, slot lag, and any blocked reason — surfaced by `riverbank runs --health`.
- **D+I change-buffer schema (v0.43).** UPDATEs are decomposed into a D-row
  (old values) + I-row (new values) at write time, eliminating the previous
  UNION ALL decomposition at read time. Simpler scan SQL, constant write
  amplification, and standard SQL tooling compatibility.

### 4.1 Stream tables with incremental view maintenance

pg_trickle's core primitive is the **stream table**: a SQL view that maintains
itself incrementally using DBSP-inspired differential dataflow. Stream tables
support full SQL coverage — JOINs, GROUP BY, WINDOW functions, EXISTS, WITH
RECURSIVE, CTEs, LATERAL, and TopK — so any derived artifact (summary counts,
entity page aggregates, topic indices, quality scores) can be expressed as
standard SQL and maintained incrementally as the underlying data changes.

Four refresh modes serve different compilation needs:

| Mode | Use case in riverbank |
|---|---|
| `AUTO` | Default for most derived views; pg_trickle decides optimal timing |
| `DIFFERENTIAL` | Force Z-set differential dataflow; best for high-change entity pages |
| `FULL` | Force complete recomputation; use for coverage maps or nightly lint passes |
| `IMMEDIATE` | Maintain within the same transaction; use for SHACL score gates that must reflect the just-written triples |

**IMMEDIATE mode** is especially important for the ingest gate: when
`load_triples_with_confidence()` writes facts, stream tables tracking SHACL
scores and entity counts can update in the same transaction, so the publication
gate decision is always based on current state.

**Watermark gating** aligns multi-source compiles: when a source arrives in
fragments from different connectors (e.g., a Confluence page with embedded
images and linked attachments), watermark gating ensures derived views only
refresh after all related fragments have landed — preventing partial-state
artifacts from reaching the trusted graph.

**Tiered scheduling** (Hot/Warm/Cold/Frozen) lets the system allocate
incremental refresh budgets by importance. High-centrality entity pages refresh
on Hot schedules; rarely-queried archive pages refresh on Cold schedules. This
aligns incremental compilation cost with structural importance, echoing the
PageRank-based cost-aware scheduling from §7.6.

**Change buffer compaction** reduces propagation work by 50–90% through
batching and deduplication of intermediate deltas, which matters when a large
source produces hundreds of triples that all need to flow through the dependency
graph.

### 4.2 pg-tide: external system integration

[pg-tide](https://github.com/trickle-labs/pg-tide)
is a standalone Rust CLI binary (extracted from pg-trickle as of v0.46.0) that bridges pg_trickle outbox and inbox tables
with external messaging systems. As of v0.6.0 it supports fifteen backends:

| Backend | Forward (outbox→sink) | Reverse (source→inbox) |
|---|---|---|
| NATS JetStream | ✅ | ✅ |
| Apache Kafka | ✅ | ✅ |
| Redis Streams | ✅ | ✅ |
| AWS SQS | ✅ | ✅ |
| RabbitMQ | ✅ | ✅ |
| HTTP webhook | ✅ | ✅ |
| PostgreSQL inbox | ✅ | — |
| stdout / file | ✅ | ✅ |
| GCP Pub/Sub | ✅ | ✅ |
| Amazon Kinesis | ✅ | ✅ |
| Azure Service Bus | ✅ | ✅ |
| Elasticsearch / OpenSearch | ✅ | — |
| MQTT v5 | ✅ | ✅ |
| Azure Event Hubs | ✅ | ✅ |
| Object Storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob) | ✅ | — |

**All pipelines are configured via SQL** — no YAML files required:

```sql
-- Attach a pg_tide outbox to a pg_trickle stream table; every non-empty
-- IVM refresh publishes a delta-summary event in the same transaction.
SELECT pgtrickle.attach_outbox('entity_updates');

-- Configure the relay: forward compiled-knowledge change events to NATS.
-- Secrets interpolated at runtime via ${env:VAR} tokens.
INSERT INTO tide.relay_outbox_config (pipeline_name, enabled, config)
VALUES ('knowledge-events', true,
    '{"stream_table": "entity_updates",
      "sink_type": "nats",
      "nats_url": "${env:NATS_URL}",
      "subject_template": "riverbank.{stream_table}.{op}"}'::jsonb);

-- Reverse: consume source documents from a Kafka topic into the inbox.
INSERT INTO tide.relay_inbox_config (pipeline_name, enabled, config)
VALUES ('source-ingest', true,
    '{"source_type": "kafka",
      "kafka_brokers": "${env:KAFKA_BROKERS}",
      "kafka_topic": "documents",
      "inbox_table": "source_inbox"}'::jsonb);
```

**Hot reload:** config changes take effect without restart — pg-tide listens
on the `tide_relay_config` PostgreSQL notification channel and reconciles
pipelines immediately on any `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` to the config
tables.

**Secret interpolation.** String values in config JSONB are scanned for
`${env:VAR_NAME}` and `${file:/run/secrets/apikey}` tokens at startup and on
every hot-reload. Unknown variables disable only the affected pipeline; all
others continue running. Values are never written to logs or Prometheus metric
labels — important for LLM API keys stored as Kubernetes secrets.

**High availability:** multiple relay instances run against the same database
with pipeline ownership distributed via PostgreSQL advisory locks — no external
coordinator (ZooKeeper, etcd) required.

This means many scenarios that would otherwise require custom Singer taps or
connector code are already handled by the relay. Singer taps remain useful for
SaaS-specific integrations (GitHub Issues, Slack, Jira) not covered by
message-queue backends.

### 4.3 What this means for the compilation pipeline

With pg_trickle, the pipeline becomes:

```
source changes -> recompile only affected fragments -> validate -> update graph
               -> refresh importance rankings (K-hop) -> publish semantic events
```

pg_trickle provides the transactional guarantees that make this safe:

- **Ingest** new source material from Kafka, NATS, HTTP, SQS, Redis Streams via
  the relay's reverse mode into PostgreSQL inbox stream tables.
- **Propagate changes** through derived views using Z-set differential dataflow,
  updating only what actually changed.
- **Publish outbound events** when compiled knowledge changes via the relay's
  forward mode, so downstream agents and systems react immediately.
- **Share transactions** with graph writes, validation, and messaging — all in
  one PostgreSQL transaction, with no partial updates.
- **Integrate with dbt** via the `stream_table` materialization — teams already
  using dbt can define derived knowledge views in familiar SQL.

That transforms the design from a batch re-indexer into a **build system for
living knowledge**.

## 5. The product: riverbank

The compiler layer is a distinct concern from storage and transport.

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **pg_ripple** | Database truth: graph writes, validation, rules, provenance, queries, entity resolution, uncertain knowledge, PageRank & centrality analytics |
| **riverbank** | Long-running AI work: document fetching, chunking, LLM calls, structured output, retries |
| **pg_trickle** | Incremental view maintenance only (v0.46.0+): stream tables, differential change propagation, IMMEDIATE-mode transactional consistency, watermark gating, tiered scheduling, pgVector incremental aggregates, W3C trace propagation; `attach_outbox()` integration point with pg-tide |
| **pg-tide** | External system bridge (v0.6.0+): forward mode (compiled knowledge→15 backends), reverse mode (external feeds→inbox), Singer target mode (Singer taps→inbox), SQL-configured pipelines, hot reload, secret interpolation, HA via advisory locks; Object Storage sink for knowledge archiving; Elasticsearch/OpenSearch sink for search index publishing |

The product promise:

> Point riverbank at a stream or corpus of human-readable knowledge. It compiles
> that material into a governed, queryable, incrementally maintained knowledge
> graph that humans, agents, and applications can use at runtime — backed by
> pg-ripple for graph storage and pg-trickle for incremental change propagation.

This is deliberately database-like. The compiled knowledge is durable,
queryable, auditable, and operationally safe.

```

The **source registry** is the key enabler of incremental compilation. The
system must remember what it compiled, when, with which prompt version, what
source hash it saw, and what knowledge depends on what. Without that memory it
is a batch re-indexer. With it, it is a build system.

## 7. What gets stored

### 7.0 Ingest gate

Before any source reaches the compilation step, it must pass a gate. The gate
has three components that compose into a strong barrier against hallucination
propagation and low-quality extraction.

**Editorial policy scoring.** Each compiler profile declares acceptance
criteria: minimum expected fact density, required field coverage, topic
relevance threshold. A source is scored against the policy before LLM extraction
begins. Below-threshold sources are kept in the `_pg_ripple.compile_rejected`
named graph with the policy score and rejection rationale — they are not
deleted, so the policy can be revised and the source reconsidered — but they
never influence the trusted graph, Datalog inference, or PageRank computation.
The editorial policy is expressed as a structured YAML document within the
compiler profile. It can be bootstrapped from a research prompt (the LLM
translates criteria into YAML at project start) and sharpened by operator
corrections pinned to an example bank.

**Write-time citation grounding.** Every extracted fact triple must carry a
`prov:wasDerivedFrom` edge pointing to the exact source fragment that produced
it, with an evidence span (character offsets or paragraph identifier). A triple
without traceable provenance is quarantined to the `_pg_ripple.compile_draft`
named graph and cannot be promoted to the trusted graph, influence Datalog
rules, or contribute to PageRank without explicit operator approval. This
constraint is enforced by the `riverbank` worker before any write
reaches the database. The difference from a soft confidence threshold: a
low-confidence fact with evidence can be reviewed, corrected, and promoted; a
fact with no evidence anchor cannot be trusted regardless of its score, because
there is no source to verify it against.

**Ingest-time schema validation.** The LLM's structured output is validated
against the compiler profile's JSON Schema before any SQL is executed. Output
that does not conform is rejected entirely — not stored with a low confidence
score — and the rejection is recorded in the compiler run diagnostics (§7.4).
This is the strongest single defense against hallucinated facts entering the
graph: a confabulated entity reference that does not resolve to an ingested
source fails at write time, not at review time.

The gate ensures that the decision to quarantine or reject is made when
provenance is freshest, not weeks later when an operator must reconstruct why a
suspicious fact was admitted.

### 7.1 Source records

For every source document or event, the registry stores:

- Source URI or external ID
- Source type (document, ticket, transcript, event stream) and system
  (Confluence, GitHub, Zendesk, Kafka)
- Content hash and last-seen timestamp
- Named graph IRI where compiled assertions live
- Compile status and last compile timestamp

This answers the operational questions that matter: What is compiled? What
changed? What failed? What is stale?

### 7.2 Source fragments

Large documents must be split into stable sections — a Markdown heading, a PDF
page, a ticket message, a transcript time segment. Fragment-level tracking is
what makes incremental compilation practical: a 50-page document should not
fully recompile when one paragraph changes.

### 7.3 Compiler profiles

Different domains need different extraction instructions. A compiler profile
defines:

- Prompt template and expected output schema
- SHACL validation rules, with `sh:severityWeight` annotations so critical
  rules weigh more in the numeric quality score
- Optional Datalog rules with `@weight` annotations for probabilistic
  confidence propagation through derived facts
- Default extraction confidence level assigned at ingest time
- Preferred LLM and embedding models, and maximum fragment size
- **Competency questions**: the SPARQL `ASK` and `SELECT` assertions the compiled graph is designed to answer. These are the questions you write before you write a single extraction rule — if the profile cannot state them, the extraction schema is not ready. The CI golden corpus gate runs each competency question against the compiled graph and fails if the result does not match. `riverbank lint --check-coverage` surfaces unanswered questions at runtime.

Profile versioning matters. Changing the prompt is changing the compiler. The
system must know which knowledge was produced by which profile version.

### 7.4 Compiler runs and diagnostics

Every compile attempt leaves a record:

- Source and fragment compiled, profile and model used, success or failure
- Token count, output hash
- Warnings: unresolved entities, weak evidence, low confidence, source
  contradictions, missing required fields, SHACL failures, output schema
  mismatches

These are the "compiler errors" from the analogy. A knowledge system that hides
its work is not trustworthy.

### 7.5 Compiled artifacts and dependency graph

A compiled artifact can be a fact, summary, entity page, Q&A pair, embedding,
index entry, or diagnostic. Each artifact records what it depends on: which
source fragment, which entity, which compiler profile, which rule set, and which
other artifacts.

That dependency graph enables incremental recompilation. When a support ticket
changes, the system asks: which facts came from this ticket? Which entity pages
used those facts? Which summaries mentioned those entities? Only those artifacts
rebuild.

### 7.6 Compiler cost accounting

Every compiler run leaves a cost record alongside its diagnostics:

- Token counts (prompt and completion), the model name, and the estimated dollar
  cost for each LLM call
- Fragment skip count — how many fragments were unchanged and not resubmitted to
  the LLM, directly measuring incremental compilation savings
- Per-run quality metrics: mean extraction confidence, contradiction count,
  SHACL score, and schema validation failure rate

These records enable three operational capabilities. **Cost dashboards** per
source, profile, and team reveal when one noisy source is consuming a
disproportionate share of LLM budget and can be scheduled less aggressively.
**Quality regression detection** makes a drop in mean extraction confidence or a
rise in SHACL failures after a prompt version update immediately visible as a
query over run history — before users notice wrong answers. **Cost-aware
scheduling** lets the incremental planner deprioritize expensive profiles for
low-importance sources (ranked by PageRank) and prioritize them for
high-centrality ones, aligning spend with structural importance.

Without this data, costs grow silently and quality regressions are invisible
until the damage is done.

### 7.7 Negative knowledge records

Not finding something is information. The system explicitly distinguishes three
kinds of absence:

- **Explicit denial**: a source directly states something is not true — "this
  product does not support SAML," "contractors are excluded from this policy."
  Stored as a negation triple with source attribution and confidence.
- **Exhaustive search failure**: the compiler searched all relevant sources for
  an owner, a date, or a required value and found none. The search scope — which
  sources were checked, when, with which profile — is recorded alongside the
  absence, so the claim "we searched and found nothing" is itself auditable.
- **Superseded fact**: a later source retracted or updated an earlier claim.
  The old fact is archived rather than deleted; audits can reconstruct what the
  system believed at any past point.

Without negative knowledge, queries return silence where they should return a
confident "no." An agent asking "which accounts have not signed the DPA?" needs
to distinguish "no signature found after searching those sources" from "we have
not yet checked" from "the source explicitly records no agreement."

### 7.8 Argument records

For corpora where the structure of reasoning matters as much as the conclusion —
policy documents, research papers, legal texts, strategy memos — the compiler
can extract the full shape of an argument rather than just its final claim.

An argument record stores:

- A central claim with confidence and source attribution
- Supporting evidence with exact evidence spans
- Objections raised in the source or flagged by the compiler
- Rebuttals to those objections, if present
- Explicit assumptions the argument depends on (linked to assumption records,
  section 7.9)

Argument records are first-class named graphs in pg_ripple. SPARQL can navigate
them: "which policy conclusions have a recorded objection but no rebuttal?" or
"which research claims share a contested assumption?"

### 7.9 Assumption records

Many compiled facts are only true under conditions the source never states
explicitly. The compiler extracts and stores these as first-class records:

- "Applies to EU jurisdiction only."
- "Assumes customer is on the Enterprise plan."
- "Valid from 2025-01-01 onwards."
- "Assumes no PII data is involved."

Assumption records are attached to facts, entity pages, and argument records.
At query time, `rag_context()` surfaces applicable assumptions alongside the
answer, so the LLM and the human reviewer see the caveats rather than
discovering them from a downstream failure.

### 7.10 Audit log

Every meaningful operation on the compiled knowledge base is appended as a
structured event triple to a dedicated named log graph:
`_pg_ripple.compile_log`. The log is append-only; entries are never modified or
deleted.

Each entry records:

- Operation type: `pgc:Ingest`, `pgc:Query` (with synthesis), `pgc:Lint`,
  `pgc:BranchMerge`, `pgc:ContractFailure`, `pgc:GateRejection`
- Timestamp (transaction time, from pg_ripple's bi-temporal machinery)
- Subject: which source, fragment, query, branch, or contract was involved
- Outcome: success, failure, warning count, cost estimate
- Operator or agent identifier

This is the graph-native equivalent of Karpathy's `log.md` — a chronological
record of what happened and when, parseable with a SPARQL filter rather than
`grep`. The key operational value: a new compiler session (or a new agent taking
over from a previous one) can query the log to understand what has already been
ingested, what was recently linted, and which contracts last failed. Without
this, every session rediscovers state from first principles.

The log feeds the cost trend dashboards (§7.6) directly. It also powers the
quality regression view: plot mean extraction confidence, contradiction rate,
and SHACL score over time, and a drop after a model upgrade becomes a visible
signal rather than a user complaint.

## 8. The compiled knowledge

The output is not a blob of text or a collection of Markdown pages. Those can
be generated for display, but the stored form is graph-native.

### 8.1 Atomic facts with confidence

Every extracted fact is an RDF triple. Additional context — confidence, source
quote, evidence span — is stored as an RDF-star annotation.

**How confidence flows through the pipeline.**
`load_triples_with_confidence(data, confidence, format, graph_uri)` assigns a
score in [0, 1] to each fact at ingest time. The score reflects the extraction
model's reliability, the source tier, and any per-field confidence returned in
structured LLM output. Datalog rules with `@weight(FLOAT)` annotations propagate
confidence through inference: a chain with weights 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.7 produces a
conclusion with confidence ~0.5. When multiple independent sources support the
same conclusion, noisy-OR combination raises the joint confidence automatically —
three sources at 0.6, 0.7, and 0.6 reach ~0.94 together. `pg:confidence(?s, ?p, ?o)`
retrieves any fact's score inline in SPARQL, usable in `FILTER`, `BIND`, and
`ORDER BY`.

**Source trust.** Registering `pg:sourceTrust 0.9` on a source named graph and
enabling `prov_confidence = on` causes built-in Datalog rules to automatically
populate confidence for every triple from that source. No per-triple annotation
is needed from the compiler.

**Quality gates.** `shacl_score(graph_iri)` returns a float in [0, 1] for the
entire compiled graph. The compiler worker uses this as a publication gate:
score >= 0.9 sends to the trusted graph; score < 0.75 sends to the review
queue. `shacl_report_scored()` provides a per-shape breakdown for the review UI.

### 8.2 Entity pages

An entity page is an entity-centered graph bundle:

- Name, aliases, type, canonical ID
- Duplicate or equivalent entity links (`owl:sameAs`)
- Short, medium, and long summaries
- Key relationships and source coverage
- Known contradictions and confidence score
- PageRank score — overall and per topic (v0.88)
- Centrality metrics: betweenness (bridge role), closeness (hub proximity) (v0.88)
- Embedding vector and community membership

Applications render this as a wiki page, JSON-LD document, API response, or LLM
context block. The stored form stays graph-native.

### 8.3 Summaries at multiple levels

The compiler generates summaries for source fragments, whole documents,
entities, topics, communities of related entities, and the corpus as a whole.
Every summary links back to the artifacts it depends on, enabling invalidation
when those artifacts change.

### 8.4 Generated questions and answers

The compiler generates question-answer pairs from source material for three
purposes:

- **Testing**: verify the knowledge base still answers correctly after an update.
- **Discovery**: help users find what the knowledge base knows.
- **Query tuning**: give `sparql_from_nl()` working examples to improve
  NL-to-SPARQL translation.

Each Q&A pair records the evidence it depends on. When that evidence updates,
the pair is flagged for regeneration.

### 8.5 The knowledge index graph

Agents need a map of the knowledge base. The index graph provides it: top-level
topics, key entities per topic ranked by importance, source coverage, freshness
metadata, representative questions, and community summaries.

With v0.88 PageRank, the index ordering is computed automatically from the
structure of the knowledge itself.

- **Freshness-aware ranking.** Temporal decay (PR-TEMPORAL-01) weights edges by
  the age of the compiled source. Recently compiled facts push more importance
  than stale ones, so the index naturally reflects recency.
- **Trust-propagating ranking.** Confidence-weighted edges (PR-CONF-01) mean
  high-trust source citations carry more rank mass than uncertain LLM
  extractions.
- **Per-domain ranking.** Topic-sensitive scoring (PR-TOPIC-01) stores
  independent ranking runs per topic label. A healthcare agent and a finance
  agent each receive a relevance-ordered index with zero extra query cost.
- **Bridge concept detection.** Betweenness centrality (PR-CENTRALITY-01)
  surfaces entities that connect otherwise separate topic clusters — entities
  that PageRank alone would miss but that an index graph must include.
- **Quality-gated ranking.** SHACL-aware ranking (PR-SHACL-01) excludes nodes
  that failed quality checks, keeping low-quality compiled facts from inflating
  the index.
- **Live incremental ranking.** The pg-trickle incremental refresh
  (PR-TRICKLE-01) propagates importance changes via bounded K-hop updates
  within seconds of a new compiled source. The `stale`/`stale_since` columns
  on `pagerank_scores` let applications distinguish exact from approximate
  scores.

### 8.6 Epistemic status layer

A confidence score tells you *how much* to trust a fact. An epistemic status
label tells you *what kind of thing* it is. The two are orthogonal and should
not be conflated: a `verified` fact at confidence 0.7 is treated very
differently from a `speculative` fact at 0.7.

Supported statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `observed` | Directly recorded from a source, not interpreted |
| `extracted` | AI-extracted from a document; subject to interpretation error |
| `inferred` | Derived by Datalog rules or RDFS/OWL reasoning |
| `verified` | Reviewed and confirmed by a human expert |
| `deprecated` | Previously true; superseded by a newer fact |
| `normative` | A rule, policy, or standard — prescriptive, not descriptive |
| `predicted` | A forecast or expected future state |
| `disputed` | Two or more sources conflict; not yet resolved |
| `speculative` | Low-confidence hypothesis included for completeness |

Status is stored as an RDF-star annotation alongside confidence. SPARQL queries
can filter by status: `FILTER(pg:status(?s, ?p, ?o) = "verified")`. Datalog
rules can be scoped to operate only on `verified` or `observed` facts, blocking
uncertain extractions from contaminating high-stakes inference chains.

### 8.7 Knowledge coverage maps

A compiled knowledge base should be explicit about what it does not know, not
just what it does. Coverage maps provide a structured record of what topics are
well-covered, where coverage is weak, and where it is absent entirely.

Coverage is measured per topic cluster by:

- Source count and recency
- Mean extraction confidence and contradiction rate
- Number of questions the compiler generated but could not answer
- Entities with no human-verified facts

This powers a "where are we blind?" query: surface topics where source density
is low, confidence is weak, or important entities have no verified facts. Teams
can prioritize documentation investment rather than waiting for a user to
discover a gap at query time.

`rag_context()` uses the coverage map when framing answers. If a targeted topic
is in a low-coverage zone, the context block includes an explicit warning:
"this topic has two sources, last updated 14 months ago — answer confidence is
limited by source freshness, not extraction quality." The knowledge base is
honest about the limits of its own knowledge.

---

## 9. Query paths

The runtime rule is simple: use compiled knowledge first; use raw source text
only to verify evidence.

### 9.1 Exact relationship questions

Questions like "Which customers requested both SSO and audit logging?", "Which
policies apply to contractors in Germany?", or "Which features have five or more
high-confidence pain points this month?" are relationship questions. They are
answered with SPARQL and Datalog over compiled facts, not by asking an LLM to do
set logic over raw text chunks.

### 9.2 Sensemaking questions

Questions like "What are the main themes in recent customer feedback?" or "What
changed in the compliance corpus this week?" start with the PageRank-ordered
index graph, communities, and summaries, then drill down into exact facts and
evidence. `pg:topN_approx()` returns approximate top-K entities sub-millisecond
for interactive sensemaking queries. Topic-sensitive scoring ensures the ranking
reflects the agent's domain, not a global average.

### 9.3 Hybrid search

No single retrieval mechanism is sufficient at scale. Three streams run in
parallel and their results are fused:

| Stream | Mechanism | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| **BM25** | PostgreSQL `tsvector` + `ts_rank_cd` with synonym expansion | Exact terms, product names, identifiers, quoted phrases |
| **Vector** | pgvector cosine similarity over compiled artifact embeddings | Semantic similarity, paraphrase, cross-language equivalences |
| **Graph traversal** | SPARQL property-path walk from seed entities outward through typed relationship edges | Structural connections, multi-hop dependencies, impact radius |

Results from all three streams are combined using **reciprocal rank fusion
(RRF)**: each document's score is `Σ 1/(k + rank_i)` where `k = 60` (the
standard constant) and `rank_i` is its position in each stream's ranked list.
Documents not retrieved by a stream contribute zero. RRF is implemented as a
small SQL function — no additional dependency, no tuning parameters.

The three streams are complementary by design. BM25 finds "Redis" when the user
asks about Redis. Vectors find Redis-related content when the user asks about
"caching layer" without using the word. Graph traversal finds everything that
*depends on* the Redis node — services, deployment configs, runbooks, ADRs —
that neither keyword nor vector search would surface.

Search targets are compiled artifacts — summaries, entity descriptions, evidence
spans, generated Q&A pairs — not raw source chunks. This matters: a chunk can
lose context; a compiled artifact has provenance, confidence, and graph edges
already attached.

`pg:fuzzy_match(a, b)` and `pg:token_set_ratio(a, b)`, backed by a GIN trigram
index, enable fuzzy entity-name matching so a query for "SSO" finds
"Single Sign-On" and "sso login" without exact string equality.
`pg:confPath(predicate, min_confidence)` traverses the compiled graph along
confidence-gated paths, preventing low-confidence edges from contaminating
multi-hop reasoning chains fed to the LLM.

The index.md catalog (§8.7 coverage map) remains useful as a human-readable
entity directory but is not the primary runtime search mechanism. Past roughly
200 entity pages the index is too large for a single-pass LLM read; the
three-stream + RRF layer handles scale without that constraint.

### 9.4 Counterfactual and explanatory queries

Beyond factual retrieval, the compiled knowledge graph supports two higher-order
query modes that make it useful for decision support and root-cause analysis.

**Counterfactual.** "What answers would change if this source were removed?" or
"What if vendor documents were trusted only up to 0.6?" The system executes the
query against a hypothetical graph — the specified source excluded or the trust
threshold adjusted — and returns the delta: facts that appear, facts that
disappear, importance scores that shift. This is useful during source audits,
trust recalibration, and policy impact analysis without modifying the live graph.

**Explain Analyze.** Instead of just returning an answer, this mode returns an
honest assessment of the answer's own reliability:

- **Answer:** yes, this policy applies.
- **Evidence strength:** medium — two sources, one dated 2023.
- **Weak point:** all evidence comes from the same document family.
- **Unresolved:** one contradicting source not yet reviewed.
- **Missing:** no current policy owner found in the knowledge base.
- **Assumption:** applies only if customer is on the Enterprise plan.
- **Coverage:** low-coverage zone — two sources, 14 months old.
- **Recommended:** review fragment X before relying on this in production.

This mode is surfaced via `rag_context(mode => 'explain_analyze')` and is
especially valuable for agent handoff: the downstream LLM receives the facts
plus a structured meta-assessment of their reliability.

### 9.5 Queries that compound the knowledge base

The act of querying can itself extend the compiled graph. When a query
synthesizes across multiple entity pages and produces a comparison, cross-source
conclusion, or explanatory summary that was not directly extractable from any
single source, that synthesis can be filed back as a compiled artifact:

```sql
SELECT pgc_file_synthesis(
    query_text  => $$ SELECT ... $$,
    result_json => :answer,
    label       => 'competitor-comparison-2026-05',
    depends_on  => ARRAY[...artifact_iris...]);
```

The resulting `pgc:Synthesis` node records the SPARQL query that produced it,
the entity pages and source fragments it drew on, the operator or agent that
requested it, and a confidence score. When any of the underlying source facts
change, synthesis nodes that depend on them are automatically flagged as stale
and regenerated in the next lint pass.

This is the graph-native form of Karpathy's insight that "good answers can be
filed back into the wiki as new pages." The effect: querying compounds the
knowledge base just as ingestion does. Each synthesis reduces future retrieval
cost (the cross-source reasoning is already done and indexed) and adds a new
node to the coverage map (§8.7). Over time, frequently asked questions become
first-class knowledge nodes rather than recomputed on every call.

## 10. What makes this novel

The article describes a compiled knowledge base. pg_ripple + pg_trickle go
further on ten fronts.

### 10.1 Live incremental compilation

The compiled output is not a static wiki refreshed overnight. It is a live
graph:

1. A source fragment changes.
2. The dependency graph identifies affected facts, summaries, entity pages, and
   Q&A pairs.
3. Only the affected artifacts rebuild.
4. SHACL validates the new output.
5. Datalog derives follow-on facts.
6. pg-trickle publishes semantic change events.
7. Downstream systems update in near real time.

This is the distinction between a batch re-indexer and a build system.

### 10.2 Knowledge CI/CD

Before new compiled knowledge is published, the system runs checks:

- Does the LLM output match the expected schema?
- Do required fields exist?
- Does `shacl_score()` exceed the publication threshold?
- Do new facts introduce contradictions?
- Do important Q&A pairs still answer correctly?
- Which answers changed?

This is a CI/CD pipeline for knowledge, not software.

### 10.3 Semantic pull requests

When a document changes, users normally review text diffs. A compiled knowledge
system can show a more informative diff:

- Facts added or removed
- Relationships changed
- Entities merged or split
- Summaries invalidated
- Contradictions introduced or resolved
- Generated answers affected
- Importance scores shifted, and why — shown by `explain_pagerank()`

Domain experts review the knowledge change instead of reading every sentence of
the source diff.

### 10.4 Uncertain knowledge and graded trust

Not all sources are equally trustworthy and not all extracted facts are equally
certain. v0.87 delivers a complete uncertain knowledge engine that makes this
concrete throughout the pipeline.

**At ingest.** `load_triples_with_confidence()` assigns extraction confidence at
load time. A primary source compiled by a reliable model gets 0.95; a web scrape
with a weaker prompt gets 0.6. A single GUC threshold routes facts below the
cutoff to the review graph instead of the trusted graph.

**Through inference.** Datalog rules with `@weight(FLOAT)` multiply body-atom
confidences by the rule weight. A chain from a medium-trust source
(0.9 x 0.8 x 0.7) produces a conclusion with confidence ~0.5, visible via
`pg:confidence()`. When multiple independent paths support the same conclusion,
noisy-OR combination raises the joint confidence automatically.

**Via source trust.** A single `pg:sourceTrust 0.9` annotation on a named graph
plus `prov_confidence = on` is enough for built-in Datalog rules to propagate
trust to every triple from that source automatically.

**As a quality gate.** `shacl_score(graph_iri)` returns a float in [0, 1].
Shapes declare `sh:severityWeight` so critical rules count more than cosmetic
ones. Graphs below 0.75 route to the review queue; `shacl_report_scored()`
explains which shapes reduced the score.

**At query time.** `FILTER(pg:confidence(?s, ?p, ?o) > 0.7)` restricts any
SPARQL query to well-supported facts. `pg:confPath(predicate, min_confidence)`
traverses only confident edges, blocking uncertain extractions from contaminating
multi-hop LLM context.

**In the importance ranking.** v0.88 confidence-weighted PageRank (PR-CONF-01)
closes the loop: entity importance reflects how *trustworthy* the incoming
citations are, not just how many there are. A policy backed by three
high-confidence extractions outranks one backed by five uncertain ones,
automatically.

**On export.** `export_turtle_with_confidence()` emits every fact with its
confidence as an RDF-star annotation. Downstream consumers see not just the
fact, but how much to trust it.

This lets the system answer:
> The strongest supported answer is A with confidence 0.82. Source B disagrees,
> but it is older and has lower trust.

### 10.5 Agent memory bus

pg_trickle publishes typed semantic events that agents subscribe to:

- `entity.updated`
- `policy.changed`
- `policy.contradiction.detected`
- `summary.invalidated`
- `source.needs_review`
- `answer_package.changed`

Agents react to meaningful knowledge changes instead of polling a vector store.

### 10.6 Human correction loops

1. The compiler extracts a fact from a transcript.
2. A domain expert corrects it in a review UI.
3. The correction travels back through pg_trickle.
4. pg_ripple stores it in a higher-priority human-review named graph.
5. Conflict rules prefer the human-reviewed fact over the lower-confidence
   LLM extraction.
6. The corrected knowledge is published downstream.

The LLM is an assistant; the expert is the source of truth.

### 10.7 Knowledge packages

A compiled corpus can be packaged for distribution:

- Named RDF graphs plus SHACL shapes and Datalog rules
- Compiler profile version and prompt hash
- Summaries, generated Q&A pairs, embeddings metadata
- Provenance manifest and evaluation set

Install a package into pg_ripple, validate it, and query it immediately.

### 10.8 Federated compiled knowledge

Organizations that cannot centralize all raw documents can compile locally and
share only approved facts. v0.88 federation blend mode (PR-FED-01) extends this
at query time: `pagerank_run()` pulls edge triples from remote SERVICE endpoints
into a temporary local graph, computes a global importance ranking across all
departments, then discards the raw remote triples. Confidence-gated federation
(PR-FED-CONF-01) filters remote edges below `federation_minimum_confidence`
before they influence the ranking, preventing low-quality external sources from
distorting global scores.

### 10.9 Active-learning review prioritization

Human expert time is the scarcest resource in any large-scale compilation
pipeline. v0.87 and v0.88 together enable a principled review queue that
maximizes the value of each correction.

The prioritization logic is: surface facts that are highly structurally important
*and* weakly supported by evidence. `pg_ripple.centrality_run('betweenness')`
identifies entities that serve as bridges between topic clusters — the concepts
most likely to propagate errors into unrelated parts of the knowledge base if
they are wrong. `pg:confidence(?s, ?p, ?o)` identifies facts that are uncertain.
Multiplying centrality by the uncertainty mass gives an actionable priority score,
expressible directly in SPARQL:

```sparql
SELECT ?entity ?type ?centrality ?confidence ?priority WHERE {
    ?entity a ?type .
    BIND(pg:centrality(?entity, 'betweenness') AS ?centrality)
    BIND(pg:confidence(?entity, rdf:type, ?type)   AS ?confidence)
    BIND(?centrality * (1.0 - ?confidence)         AS ?priority)
    FILTER(?centrality > 0.05 && ?confidence < 0.8)
}
ORDER BY DESC(?priority)
LIMIT 50
```

A human correcting a high-centrality, low-confidence fact eliminates the most
potential error propagation per review hour. When the correction lands — stored
in the human-review named graph at higher priority — pg-trickle propagates the
updated confidence through all downstream derivations, Datalog rules re-evaluate,
and the review queue re-ranks automatically.

This is active learning applied to knowledge compilation: the system directs
reviewer attention to where it has the highest expected value, rather than
presenting facts in arrival order.

### 10.10 Bi-temporal knowledge management

The compiler pipeline introduces two distinct time dimensions that must not be
conflated.

**Valid time** is when a fact was true in the world. "The policy required MFA
from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31" has a finite valid interval. After expiry the
fact is not wrong — it is archived. An agent asking "what are the current
requirements?" should not see it; an auditor asking "what applied in March 2024?"
must.

**Transaction time** is when the fact was compiled into the knowledge base.
"We compiled this triple on 2026-02-15, from a page last modified on
2026-02-12" captures when the system *knew* what it knew.

pg_ripple's existing named-graph time-travel queries and RDF-star annotations
support both dimensions. The compiler pipeline connects them: every compiled
artifact records its source timestamp as the start of the valid interval (when
extractable), and its compile timestamp as the transaction time. Temporal
PageRank decay (PR-TEMPORAL-01) uses the valid-time edge weight rather than the
compile time, so recently re-compiled but factually stale facts do not
artificially inflate importance scores.

Three operational capabilities follow from maintaining both dimensions:

- **Fact expiry.** SHACL shapes can declare `sh:validUntil` on named graphs. The
  incremental planner automatically retires facts whose valid time has passed to
  an archive graph — without deleting them — so audits remain answerable over
  the full history.
- **Temporal audit.** "What did the knowledge base believe on date X?" is
  answerable via a named-graph time-travel query, with no special backup or
  snapshot machinery required.
- **Staleness detection.** The gap between source modification time and compile
  time is a staleness signal. Sources where compile latency has grown well
  beyond the typical median are candidates for an out-of-cycle recompile before
  their facts distort importance rankings.

### 10.11 Semantic branches

Knowledge bases change. Not every change should go directly into production.
Semantic branches let teams run compilation experiments safely:

- "What does the KB look like if we recompile all sources with the new model?"
- "What if we reduce vendor trust to 0.6?"
- "What if we accept the disputed entity merge for customer A?"

A branch is a named copy of a named-graph set. Compilation runs against the
branch without touching the live graph. The system produces a semantic diff:
facts added, facts removed, relationships changed, summaries invalidated,
PageRank scores shifted and why. Domain experts review the *knowledge change* —
not a raw source text diff — and approve the merge when satisfied.

This is a semantic pull request. It turns knowledge governance from a policing
activity into a structured, reviewable workflow, identical in spirit to the code
review process that production software depends on.

### 10.12 Negative knowledge and epistemic status

The existing pipeline excels at recording what it knows. This extends it to
record what it knowingly does not know, and what *kind of thing* everything it
knows is.

**Negative knowledge** (section 7.7) closes the open-world assumption that
causes most knowledge bases to return silence when they should return a
confident "no." Three categories — explicit source denials, exhaustive-search
failures with documented scope, and superseded facts archived rather than deleted
— give the system a complete picture. An agent working from a knowledge base
that distinguishes "not found after searching" from "explicitly denied" produces
far fewer confident wrong answers.

**Epistemic status** (section 8.6) adds a dimension orthogonal to confidence.
A `verified` fact at confidence 0.7 is fundamentally different from a
`speculative` fact at 0.7. A `normative` rule should never be treated the same
as an `extracted` observation. Status labels let SPARQL queries, Datalog rules,
and LLM context builders filter by the *kind* of knowledge they need, not just
its degree of certainty.

Together they make the compiled graph honest about the shape of its own
ignorance — which turns out to be the most important quality for a system that
downstream agents will trust with real decisions.

### 10.13 Argument graphs and assumption registries

For any corpus where reasoning matters — legal, compliance, research, strategy —
flat facts are necessary but insufficient. The structure of an argument is
itself knowledge: how does a conclusion follow from its premises? What objections
does the source acknowledge? What assumptions does it rely on without stating?

Storing argument structure (section 7.8) enables queries that fact extraction
alone cannot answer:

- "Which policy conclusions have acknowledged objections without rebuttals?"
- "Which research claims rest on contested assumptions?"
- "Where do two documents reach the same conclusion via incompatible reasoning?"

The **assumption registry** (section 7.9) is the most practically valuable
output: every condition that scopes the validity of a compiled fact is surfaced
at query time via `rag_context()`. Downstream agents and human reviewers see the
caveats alongside the answer rather than having to rediscover them from a
production failure.

This is the difference between a knowledge base that gives an answer and one
that gives an answer the reader can actually reason about.

### 10.14 Answer contracts

Generated Q&A pairs (section 8.4) test whether the knowledge base *can* answer
a question. Answer contracts test whether it *still* answers it *correctly* —
as defined by a domain expert.

When a human expert corrects an answer, that correction becomes a binding
contract. Every recompile re-runs every contract. A contract that breaks —
because a source changed, a new contradiction arrived, or a compiler profile was
updated — surfaces immediately as a test failure in CI, not as a user complaint
weeks later.

The key distinction from generated Q&A: answer contracts capture real user
intent and real failure modes. They express what a domain expert agreed the
system must always say. That makes them the highest signal-to-noise regression
test a knowledge system can have. Like a unit test suite, their value compounds
over time: the more contracts are registered, the harder it is to silently
regress the quality of the knowledge base.

### 10.15 Semantic watchpoints

pg-trickle already publishes events when knowledge changes (section 10.5).
Semantic watchpoints let users subscribe to *conditions*, not just change types.

Instead of "notify me when any triple changes in graph G," a watchpoint
registers a SPARQL query against pg-trickle's outbox:

- "Alert me if any policy affecting contractors in Germany changes."
- "Warn me if confidence on any SOC 2 control drops below 0.8."
- "Notify me if a human-verified fact gets contradicted by a new source."
- "Alert me if a top-20 customer account gets linked to a churn risk signal."

When a recompile produces results that satisfy the watchpoint query, an event
fires. This makes the knowledge base proactive: it tells people what changed
that matters to them, rather than requiring them to poll, search, or wait for
an agent to notice. High-importance watchpoints can also block a branch merge
until a domain expert reviews the triggered condition.

### 10.16 Learned source reputation

Static source trust scores are useful but brittle. A source that was reliable in
2023 may have drifted; a source initially treated with skepticism may have proved
itself consistently accurate.

Learned reputation closes the loop between the review queue (section 10.6) and
future compilation. The system observes correction outcomes over time:

- If a reviewer consistently lowers confidence for facts from source S, that
  source's baseline trust score decreases for future compiles.
- If a source's facts consistently survive review unchanged, its trust score
  rises toward the maximum permitted by its tier.
- Changes are gradual and bounded — no single correction swings a whole source.

The effect compounds. High-reputation sources get facts compiled with higher
initial confidence, pass SHACL gates more easily, and contribute more weight to
PageRank. Low-reputation sources feed the review queue more aggressively.
The system's behaviour improves as humans use it: curation activity becomes a
form of ongoing training, not just correction.

### 10.17 Model ensemble disagreement

LLM extraction is probabilistic. Running a single model over a source once is
not the same as knowing what the source says. For high-stakes corpora —
compliance documents, safety policies, contract terms — ensemble compilation
provides a practical reliability guarantee.

The compiler runs N model or prompt variants over the same source fragment:

- **All agree**: confidence bonus applied; fact fast-tracked to the trusted graph.
- **Majority agree**: majority result taken; dissenting positions recorded as
  `disputed` RDF-star annotations.
- **No consensus**: entire fragment routed to the human review queue with all
  N outputs shown side-by-side.

Ensemble compilation is controlled per compiler profile. It is an explicit
opt-in for high-value corpora, not the default path, because it multiplies LLM
cost by N. The cost is recorded per run (section 7.6) and surfaced in cost
dashboards before a profile is enabled in production.

### 10.18 Minimal contradiction explanations

When the graph detects a contradiction, the current behaviour is to flag it.
That is necessary but not sufficient: "the graph contains a contradiction" tells
a reviewer almost nothing about where to look or what to fix.

Minimal contradiction explanation computes the smallest set of facts and rules
that together produce the conflict — analogous to an unsatisfiable core in
formal verification. The system presents the contradiction as a structured
review record:

- **Contradiction location:** policy-de-contractors
- **Minimal cause (3 facts):**
  1. `:policyDE applies_to :contractors` — policy-de-v3, confidence 0.9
  2. `:contractors subClassOf :excluded_workers` — extracted 2024-11, confidence 0.6
  3. `:policyDE excludes :excluded_workers` — policy-de-v1, confidence 0.85
- **Likely fix:** fact 2 is the lowest-confidence and most recent extraction;
  review fragment `policy-excerpt-2024-11-contractors` to resolve.

The explanation is stored as a named graph, surfaced in the review UI, and
included in semantic diff output for branch merges. It turns a contradiction
from a problem requiring full graph archaeology into a three-line action item
with a clear suggested starting point.

### 10.19 Privacy-preserving views

The same underlying graph needs to be exposed differently to different audiences.
A support agent, a sales engineer, an executive, a regulator, and a public API
consumer each need a different window onto the same facts — and inferring beyond
that window should be impossible, not just unlikely.

Privacy-preserving views are named projections with explicit per-view rules:

| View | Allowed predicates | Confidence threshold | Redaction |
|---|---|---|---|
| `view:support` | product, policy, status | ≥ 0.7 | PII masked |
| `view:sales` | product, customer-segment | ≥ 0.8 | competitor refs removed |
| `view:exec` | summaries, KPIs, risk | ≥ 0.85 | no raw evidence |
| `view:audit` | all, including archived | any | full provenance visible |
| `view:public` | published subset only | ≥ 0.9 | max 1-hop from entry |

Views are enforced at query time by row-level policy on VP tables and named-graph
ACLs. pg-trickle outboxes publish only to views a subscription is permitted to
see. This is stronger than access control alone: it limits what can be
*inferred*, not just what can be read directly. A support agent cannot
reconstruct a competitor analysis from permitted support facts.

### 10.20 Knowledge coverage maps

A knowledge base that cannot describe its own gaps will surprise users at the
worst moments. Coverage maps (section 8.7) make ignorance explicit, queryable,
and actionable.

The coverage map is a compiled artifact updated alongside the main graph:
topic clusters annotated with source density, mean confidence, recency,
contradiction rate, and unanswered-question count. It is queryable in SPARQL,
includable in `rag_context()`, and renderable as a dashboard.

Three operational uses follow. **Documentation targeting**: coverage gaps surface
as a prioritized list — the topics where adding one good source would reduce the
most uncertainty. **Answer framing**: `rag_context()` embeds coverage warnings
so downstream consumers know when an answer is limited by source availability
rather than extraction quality. **Watchpoints**: a coverage map below a
threshold for a critical topic fires a semantic watchpoint (section 10.15),
prompting a documentation review before users encounter the gap.

The coverage map closes a fundamental gap in knowledge system design: most
systems can tell you what they know; few can tell you, with evidence, what they
do not know and why.

### 10.21 Lint as a first-class operation

The lint operation is not a background health check. It is a named, schedulable,
operator-initiated workflow that produces actionable structured output.

A lint pass examines the compiled graph for:

- **Contradictions** between entity pages or across source graphs — surfaced
  with minimal contradiction explanations (§10.18)
- **Stale claims** whose source has been superseded by a newer compilation since
  the fact was written
- **Orphan artifacts** — entity pages or summaries with no inbound links from
  the topic index graph
- **Missing cross-references** — entities mentioned across multiple pages but
  not connected by a named relationship triple
- **Data gaps** — topics with low source density, high unanswered-question
  count, or mean confidence below the coverage threshold (§8.7)
- **Expired facts** — facts whose `sh:validUntil` has passed but have not been
  moved to the archive graph

Lint output is a structured named graph of `pgc:LintFinding` nodes, each
linking to the affected artifact, the rule that triggered it, and a suggested
resolution. High-severity findings fire semantic watchpoints (§10.15). Lint
findings are queryable in SPARQL:

```sparql
SELECT ?artifact ?severity ?rule ?suggestion WHERE {
    GRAPH pgc:lintFindings {
        ?finding a pgc:LintFinding ;
                 pgc:severity ?severity ;
                 pgc:affects  ?artifact ;
                 pgc:rule     ?rule ;
                 pgc:suggests ?suggestion .
    }
    FILTER(?severity IN ("high", "critical"))
}
ORDER BY DESC(?severity)
```

Lint runs automatically after each batch ingest and on a configurable schedule.
But it is also an explicit operator-initiated command — "lint the compliance
corpus" is a thing a domain expert can request, review, and act on as a unit of
work, not just a background metric trend.

## 11. Example use cases

### 11.1 Enterprise documentation

**Sources:** Confluence pages, GitHub Markdown, policy PDFs, decision logs

**Compiled:** Policies, owners, effective dates, required approvals, exceptions,
related systems, contradictions between documents.

**Why it matters:** Policy questions need exact scope, dates, and exceptions —
that is structured graph reasoning, not chunk retrieval. Temporal decay (v0.88)
surfaces the most recently updated policies at the top of the index, so agents
find the authoritative current version before superseded ones.

### 11.2 Product intelligence

**Sources:** Support tickets, call transcripts, CRM notes, feedback forms

**Compiled:** Customers, accounts, features, pain points, sentiment, urgency,
evidence quotes, duplicate requests.

**Why it matters:** The result is not a pile of summaries. It is a live product
graph: which accounts asked for what, how confident we are, what evidence
supports it, and how the trend changed. Topic-sensitive PageRank (PR-TOPIC-01)
ranks features by how heavily they are requested within a given product area,
surfacing the top pain points automatically as the feedback graph grows.

### 11.3 Research library

**Sources:** Papers, lab notes, benchmark reports, citations, experiment metadata

**Compiled:** Claims, methods, datasets, metrics, baselines, limitations,
conflicting results, open questions.

**Why it matters:** A new paper can strengthen or contradict existing claims.
The system shows what changed in the research map, not just a summary of the new
paper. Eigenvector centrality (v0.88) identifies the claims backed by the
strongest mutually corroborating chains of evidence, distinguishing them from
popular but weakly-supported assertions.

### 11.4 Operations memory

**Sources:** Alerts, incident reports, deployment events, runbook changes

**Compiled:** Symptoms, affected services, owners, deploys, probable causes,
remediation steps, runbook links.

**Why it matters:** "What changed before this alert pattern appeared?" requires
evidence from previous incidents, deployments, and runbooks — exactly what
structured graph reasoning over compiled operational knowledge provides.

### 11.5 Compliance and governance workflows

**Sources:** Regulatory texts, legal contracts, policy amendments, audit reports,
compliance questionnaires, exception logs, evidence packages

**Compiled:** Regulatory requirements with scope, effective dates, and applicable
entities; control owners; exception history; contradictions between policy
versions; argument structure behind compliance decisions including acknowledged
objections; assumption records scoping each rule's applicability.

**Why it matters:** Compliance questions are not fuzzy similarity problems. They
require exact scope resolution ("does Article 17 apply to this data category?"),
temporal precision ("what was the policy on 2024-03-15?"), and audit-grade
evidence trails. The advanced epistemic features are what make the difference:

- **Argument graphs** capture the full reasoning behind compliance decisions,
  including acknowledged objections and rebuttal chains — not just the
  conclusion an auditor is asked to accept.
- **Assumption records** surface the conditions under which a policy applies,
  preventing it from being applied in the wrong jurisdiction or plan tier.
- **Answer contracts** lock in the answers to recurring compliance questions; a
  regulatory update that changes an answer surfaces immediately as a contract
  failure before any user is affected.
- **Negative knowledge** handles the "prove you searched and found no exemption"
  requirement that pure retrieval systems cannot meet.
- **Privacy-preserving views** let auditors see the full evidence trail while
  limiting what the support and engineering teams can infer from the same graph.

## 12. First version

The first version should prove the idea with one strong end-to-end flow: a
source changes, only the affected part recompiles, the graph is updated,
validation runs, and a meaningful change event is published.

### 12.1 MVP features

1. Source registry: sources, fragments, profiles, runs, diagnostics.
2. Compiler profiles with prompt template, version, output schema, and
   validation rules.
3. `riverbank` worker with an OpenAI-compatible endpoint and a
   deterministic mock mode for CI.
4. Compiled artifacts: atomic facts, summaries, entity pages, Q&A pairs,
   diagnostics.
5. Statement-level provenance and confidence via `load_triples_with_confidence()`.
6. `shacl_score()` as a numeric publication gate; graphs below threshold route
   to the diagnostic review queue.
7. Named graph write modes: append, replace, and review.
8. A topic index graph with top-N entities ranked by PageRank and temporal
   decay.
9. pg-trickle inbox for source events and outbox for artifact change events.

### 12.2 What to avoid in the first version

- No custom UI.
- No general workflow DAG editor.
- No large connector catalog.
- No automatic trust in LLM-extracted facts.
- No full-corpus re-summarization on every change.
- No hidden destructive deletes during recompilation.
- No semantic branching — branch/diff/merge workflows are Phase 6.
- No model ensemble compilation — deferred until the single-model pipeline is stable.
- No argument graph extraction — too structurally complex for an MVP.

## 14. How to measure success

### Compile-time metrics

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Fragment skip rate (unchanged fragments) | > 80% on re-runs |
| LLM structured-output failure rate | < 5% |
| Mean `pg:confidence()` of extracted facts | > 0.75 per run |
| `shacl_score()` of published graphs | > 0.9 |
| Contradiction rate | < 2% |
| Facts with evidence attached | > 95% |
| Negative knowledge coverage (explicit absent/denied fields recorded) | > 50% of expected-absent fields |
| Epistemic status annotation rate | > 95% of compiled facts |
| Answer contract pass rate | 100% |

### Incremental-update metrics

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Source change to updated graph | < 10 s |
| Source change to refreshed summaries | < 30 s |
| Source change to outbound event | < 5 s |
| Unnecessary full recompiles avoided | > 90% of updates |
| PageRank score stabilization after new compile | < 5 s via PR-TRICKLE-01 |

### Query-time metrics

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| PageRank top-10 precision vs. human judgement | > 0.8 |
| SPARQL generation repair rate | < 10% |
| Accuracy on generated QA sets | > 85% |
| Accuracy on multi-hop questions | Outperform vector RAG |
| Contradiction disclosure rate | 100% |
| Coverage map gap identification rate (before user-reported) | > 90% |
| Explain Analyze evidence-strength disclosure rate | 100% |

### Comparison benchmark

Run four approaches on the same corpus:

1. Vector RAG over raw chunks
2. Static LLM-generated wiki
3. Batch GraphRAG-style graph
4. pg_ripple + pg_trickle live compiled graph

The combined approach should do especially well on multi-hop questions,
aggregation, contradiction detection, change-awareness queries, and broad
sensemaking that still requires structured evidence.

### Evaluation framework: making the metrics verifiable

Targets in a table are aspirational until there is a repeatable way to measure
them. Three practices make the metrics above into verified properties of the
system.

**Golden corpus and SPARQL assertions.** Maintain a small, human-curated corpus
of source documents with hand-verified expected facts, relationships, and
summaries. Express each expectation as a SPARQL `ASK` or `SELECT` assertion
stored in `tests/knowledge_base/`. Every compiler profile change, model version
bump, or pg_ripple upgrade runs this suite as part of CI. A regression means
something measurable broke, not that a summary "feels worse".

**QA pair consistency checking.** The compiler generates Q&A pairs (section 8.4)
from source material. After each recompile, re-run every pair through the
inference path and verify the answer still matches. A `shacl_score()` above
threshold says the graph is structurally valid; a QA regression says it answers
differently than before. Both signals are needed, because structural validity
and answer correctness can diverge.

**Compiler run trend dashboards.** Query the compiler run history (sections 7.4
and 7.6) to plot mean extraction confidence, contradiction rate, SHACL score,
and fragment skip rate over time. A decline after a model upgrade is a deployment
signal. A rise after a prompt improvement confirms the change was worth the cost.
Without these trends, the quality metrics in the tables above are spot-checked
at best.

---

## 15. Risks and guardrails

### Prompt injection

Raw documents may contain instructions aimed at the LLM. This is a structural
threat, not an edge case: a public support ticket, a scraped web page, or a
third-party document feed can include carefully crafted text designed to override
the extraction prompt. Four defenses compose into a practical barrier.

**Framing.** Compiler profile templates wrap source text inside a clearly
delimited data block with an explicit instruction that the content is data to be
processed, not instructions to be followed. Role-based prompting that separates
the system persona from the source material further reduces susceptibility.

**Structured output as a type boundary.** Requiring JSON Schema output from the
LLM and validating it strictly against the compiler profile's schema before any
content enters the database is the strongest single defense. A fact that does not
match the schema is rejected, not interpreted. The `riverbank` worker
validates LLM output before calling any pg_ripple SQL function.

**Named graph quarantine.** LLM output that passes schema validation but fails
SHACL checks or falls below the `shacl_score()` threshold is written to a
quarantine named graph, not the trusted graph. An operator reviews and approves
promotion. This provides defense-in-depth: even if a prompt injection produces a
syntactically valid but semantically malicious fact — for example, a false
`owl:sameAs` link that merges two distinct entities — it lands in quarantine
where it cannot influence Datalog inference, PageRank computation, or outbound
pg-trickle events until a human approves it.

**Evidence anchoring.** Every compiled fact carries an evidence span pointing to
the exact source fragment that generated it. When a suspicious fact appears in
the review queue, an operator can inspect the source quote. Facts without
traceable evidence can be rejected by policy, making evidence anchoring both a
provenance feature and a security control.

### Hallucinated facts

The compiler will occasionally extract wrong facts. Every fact must carry
evidence and confidence. Facts below the `load_triples_with_confidence()`
threshold go to a named review graph, not the trusted graph. `pg:confidence()`
surfaces below-threshold facts for human inspection. Accepted facts can be
promoted with an updated confidence score without full recompilation.

### Lossy compilation and hallucination propagation

An LLM knowledge compiler is lossy by design: it takes raw documents and
rewrites them into derived facts, summaries, and entity pages. That compression
can drop caveats, dates, minority views, exact wording, and source context. Once
people query the compiled form instead of the original, summary errors become
embedded in the knowledge base and propagate into downstream inferences.

The triple-level model is materially less lossy than prose rewrite for three
reasons: facts are stored and correctable at the triple level rather than the
paragraph level (each fact can be independently revised without rewriting a
page); the raw source is always retained and linked via `prov:wasDerivedFrom`
(the source of truth is always one hop away); and the confidence score encodes
uncertainty explicitly rather than embedding it in hedging prose that downstream
summaries may or may not reproduce.

The ingest gate (§7.0) is the primary structural defense against hallucination
propagation. A confabulated citation that does not resolve to an ingested source
fails at write time. A fact without an evidence anchor cannot be promoted from
the draft graph. Contradiction detection runs on every compile. These combine
to make error propagation a diagnosable failure mode rather than a silent one.

### Destructive recompilation

Deleting and rebuilding a whole source graph is risky in production. Production
mode should prefer staging, review, or diff-based updates.

### Sensitive data leakage

Summaries can leak sensitive content. Compiler profiles should support
redaction, graph-level access control, and output policies. pg-trickle outboxes
should publish only what a subscription is permitted to expose.

### Non-determinism

LLM output varies. Store model name, prompt version, input hash, output hash,
temperature, and run metadata. High-stakes domains should use deterministic
settings and require human review.

### Cost growth

Without fragment hashing and dependency tracking, this becomes an expensive
batch re-indexer. Incremental compilation is not an optional optimization — it
is central to the design. Cost grows proportionally to what actually changed, not
proportionally to corpus size.

### Trust confusion

An LLM-extracted assertion is not the same as a verified business fact. The
`_pg_ripple.confidence` side table keeps source assertions, compiler assertions,
human-reviewed assertions, and trust-propagated scores in separate rows keyed by
model label (`'llm-extract'`, `'human-review'`, `'prov-trust'`). Row-level
security mirrors the named-graph VP-table policies. `pg:confidence()` returns
the highest-confidence row; callers who need the per-model breakdown query the
side table directly.

### Model ensemble cost

Model ensemble compilation (section 10.17) multiplies LLM cost by N per
fragment. Without explicit profile-level configuration it can silently inflate
costs to unacceptable levels. Three guardrails are required: ensemble
compilation must be an explicit opt-in per compiler profile; each profile must
declare a hard cap on maximum N per run; and cost estimates must be shown before
a profile is enabled in production. The per-run cost records (section 7.6)
should include an ensemble multiplier field so dashboards can distinguish
ensemble cost from single-model baseline cost.

### Multi-agent coordination

When multiple agents compile the same knowledge base across sessions — or when
multiple compiler workers run in parallel — predictable coordination failures
emerge: duplicate extraction of the same fragment, conflicting entity
resolutions, and schema drift where each agent interprets the compiler profile
slightly differently.

Three guardrails compose into a practical solution. **Fragment-level
idempotency:** every compilation run is keyed by source IRI + content hash +
profile version + model name (§7.4). A second agent that attempts to recompile
the same unchanged fragment finds the run record already present and skips.
**Transaction-level isolation:** the `riverbank` worker takes a
PostgreSQL advisory lock per source IRI during compilation; two workers cannot
race on the same source. **Profile-as-schema:** the compiler profile is stored
in the database, versioned, and fetched by each worker at the start of a run —
it is not a file each agent reads fresh and interprets independently. Schema
drift is structurally prevented: all workers at the same profile version see
the same schema.

These guardrails make multi-agent compilation a design requirement for any team
deployment, not an afterthought. They also directly address the six-failure
pattern observed in flat-file multi-agent wiki deployments: duplicate pages,
hidden parallel work, per-agent schema drift, inconsistent policy boundaries,
and open questions that die between sessions.

## 16. Recommended next steps

1. Pick one demo corpus: a Markdown documentation set or a support-ticket
   export.
2. Define a small `pgc:` vocabulary for compiled knowledge artifacts: source,
   fragment, profile, run, artifact, dependency.
3. Draft the catalog schema for sources, fragments, profiles, runs, diagnostics,
   and artifacts.
4. Prototype riverbank as a standalone worker that calls pg-ripple and pg-trickle
   SQL functions.
5. Add a deterministic mock compiler profile for CI.
6. Show one complete incremental update: source change, partial recompile,
   graph update, SHACL validation, pg-trickle outbox event.
7. Validate the uncertain knowledge pipeline: load compiled facts via
   `load_triples_with_confidence()`, run Datalog rules with `@weight`, verify
   derived confidence via `pg:confidence()`, confirm `shacl_score()` gates
   publication.
8. Run `pagerank_run()` with temporal decay over the compiled graph; enable
   PR-TRICKLE-01 incremental refresh and confirm scores update within seconds
   of a new compile.
9. Compare against raw vector RAG on multi-hop questions, aggregation,
   contradiction detection, and change-awareness queries.
10. Build the compiler cost dashboard: query the run history (section 7.6) to
    plot extraction confidence, SHACL score, and estimated cost over time; set
    up quality regression alerts.
11. Establish a golden SPARQL assertion suite for the demo corpus and run it in
    CI; add a QA consistency check that re-runs generated Q&A pairs after every
    recompile.
12. Extend the `pgc:` vocabulary for negative knowledge, argument records,
    assumption records, and epistemic status; document the expected RDF-star
    annotation structure for each.
13. Prototype semantic branches as named-graph copies; implement a
    `pg_ripple_branch_diff()` SQL function that returns a semantic diff — facts
    added, removed, confidence changed — between two branch graphs.
14. Register three answer contracts against the demo corpus and verify they run
    as CI assertions on every recompile; confirm that a deliberate source change
    triggers a contract failure.
15. Define one coverage map shape and verify that `rag_context()` emits a
    coverage warning when a queried topic is below the density threshold.

The strongest demo shows what the article only hints at: a knowledge base that
behaves like a real build system. A source changes. Only the dependent knowledge
rebuilds. The system validates the result, explains what changed, and publishes
a semantic event. That is where pg_ripple and pg_trickle become more than an
implementation of the compiler analogy. They become the runtime for living
knowledge.

## 17. Where the graph beats the flat-file wiki at scale

The community that has built on Karpathy's pattern — SwarmVault, Kompl,
TheKnowledge, and a dozen others — has converged on the flat-file markdown vault
as the storage primitive. It is portable, human-readable, and integrates with
Obsidian's graph view. At small-to-medium scale (~100–500 sources) it works
well.

At larger scale, or in team, multi-agent, or high-stakes deployments, the
pattern runs into five structural limits. This section states them plainly,
because understanding them clarifies why riverbank is not just a heavier
implementation of the same idea.

**The scale problem: similarity vs. traversal.** At ~100 sources the index file
is enough. At 1,500+ sources, text similarity search finds pages that mention
the same words — but traversal finds pages that are structurally connected even
when they share no text. The community implementing Karpathy's pattern at that
scale independently discovered they needed graph traversal, not search. That is
exactly what pg_ripple's SPARQL engine provides: it does not find entities that
mention "VP tables"; it finds entities that participate in the same decision
graph as VP tables, connected via named relationships, regardless of what words
appear on any page.

**The provenance problem: prose citations vs. machine-readable edges.** Flat-file
wikis embed citations as `[[wikilink]]` syntax. Parsing and validating them
requires another LLM or NLP pass. In pg_ripple, every fact triple carries a
`prov:wasDerivedFrom` edge that is a first-class graph edge — queryable,
joinable, and enforceable at write time. Orphaned citations are structurally
prevented by the ingest gate (§7.0): if the source is not in the ingested graph,
the write is rejected.

**The temporal problem: frontmatter vs. bi-temporal facts.** A markdown file can
carry a `date:` frontmatter field. It cannot represent that a fact was valid from
2023-01-01 to 2024-06-30, was compiled on 2025-03-10, and was superseded by a
different fact on 2026-01-01. pg_ripple's bi-temporal model (§10.10) handles all
four timestamps as structured data, not prose metadata — and makes every
historical state queryable without snapshots.

**The multi-agent problem: drift and duplication.** When multiple agents maintain
the same flat-file vault across sessions, the community has documented six
predictable failures: schema drift between agents, silent parallel creation of
duplicate pages, self-attributed canonical status that other agents ignore,
inconsistent policy boundaries, no structured back-channel for in-session
observations, and open questions that die in chat history. pg_ripple's
named-graph model and versioned compiler profiles eliminate these by design: the
schema is a versioned database artifact, not a markdown file each agent reads
fresh and interprets independently (§15: Multi-agent coordination).

**The inference problem: links vs. rules.** A flat-file wiki can record that
entity A is related to entity B via a wikilink. It cannot derive that a
compliance rule applies to a new contract because the contract matches three
conditions defined in three separate documents. pg_ripple's Datalog layer closes
this gap: facts inferred by rules are first-class triples with confidence scores,
provenance, and epistemic status labels, distinguishable from directly extracted
facts and ineligible for promotion without evidence anchors.

The right summary: the flat-file wiki is an excellent **output format** for human
consumption and an excellent **input format** for LLM context. It is not the
right **storage format** for a knowledge system that must be queried, inferred
over, validated, incrementally updated, and audited.
`riverbank` uses graph-native storage internally and generates flat-file
output (Turtle, JSON-LD, Markdown entity pages) as a rendering step — giving
human readers the familiar wiki surface while keeping the durable store
machine-queryable.
